We are pleased to announce that the **Short and long timescales in Speciation Genomics: Machine Learning approaches** (MLSpeciationGenomics) meeting will take place in St Andrews from 24th to 27th June 2025.

How new species emerge is one of the big questions in evolutionary biology. Speciation genomics investigates the genetic basis of this process. Until recently researchers were only able to sequence a few individuals at a single time-point. Yet, with the growing affordability of genome sequencing, it is now possible to consider multiple individuals at multiple points in time.

These multiple time-points could include samples from Natural History Museums, they could be multiple generations of a population housed in controlled laboratory environments or diverse samples collected from the wild. This workshop will bring researchers together to make the best use of the new data, we will have talks as well as hands-on sessions on museum genomics, phylogenomics and machine learning methods.

## Faculty
