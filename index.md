We are pleased to announce that the **Short and long timescales in Speciation Genomics: Machine Learning approaches** (MLSpeciationGenomics) meeting will take place in St Andrews from 24th to 27th June 2025.

The MLGenomics meeting intends to stimulate a broader discussion on novel phylogenomic models. The keynote talks will focus on the computational and statistical aspects of using large and heterogeneous sequences to build species trees and perform inference.

As part of this meeting, we will hold workshops. The main focus will be Museum Genomics, Phylogenomics and Machine Learning exercises.
